# Web App for Riparian Models

The **Web App for Riparian Models**, or **WARM**, is a graphical user-interface that can be used to conduct riparian assessment calculations using select and existing riparian models. Users may interact with a menu which helps guide the user to aid in searching for a riparian model and their respective calculators. This web app evaluates riparian models using "Review of Riparian Models for Assessing Ecological Impacts and Benefits" (Wiest et al.,2003) by evaluating the existing riparian tools relative to model objectives, modeling approach, and input variables via user input.

More information on the "Review of Riparian Models for Assessing Ecological Impacts and Benefits" can be found on the RiparianModelReviewSubmitted.docx. Information pertaining to the WRISES team and their ongoing work can be found on https://github.com/USACE-WRISES.
