Resaca Reference Condition Model (RRCM),"This model uses a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) framework[1] to assess restoration sites for resaca ecosystems (a dry channel or former marshy course of a stream) based on three vegetation communities: Texas Ebony Resaca Forest, Subtropical Texas Palmetto Woodland, and Texas Ebony/Snake-eyes Shrubland (USACE, 2016).

Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS),"This HSI-based tool is designed to capture habitat changes from common management actions in floodplain forests (also known as “bottomland forests and “wooded swamps and floodplains”). The model assesses “silvicultural prescriptions” at a scale of “management areas”, which are typically 5-100 acres (USACE 2021).",Southeast,Conceptual/Index,Wetland forest system dominated by hardwoods in eastern US.

Modified Riverine HSI Model for Mink,"This HSI model evaluates riverine cover types and their potential for providing year-round habitat for the mink species.

Community-Based Ecosystem Response Model for the Cottonwood Riparian Forests of Missouri River,"The Missouri River model's purpose is to assess ecosystem benefits, specifically for Cottonwood riparian forests, through a community-based ecosystem response model. The model utilizes community- or ecosystem-scale indices (as opposed to taxa-specific models) to assess ecosystem functions on a broader and more complex, landscape scale (Burkes-Copes, 2016).",West/Midwest/Southeast,Conceptual/Index/Analytical/Spatial,Cottonwood-forested communities along the Missouri River.,Informal review via development; panel review; USACE certification,Access database format and spreadsheet file,1,,,,,2,1,2,1,,1,3,
Middle Rio Grande Bosque Riparian Community Index Model,"The Middle Rio Grande model quantifies the effects of changes in ‘bosque’ (riparian) ecosystems of central New Mexico. The HSI-style model focuses the unique and culturally significant ‘bosque’ communities in New Mexico due to its diminishing habitat and ecosystem functions (Burkes-Copes and Webb, 2012).",Southwest,Conceptual/Index/Analytical/Spatial,"Riparian habitat between levees along Middle Rio Grande, NM.

Ecological Functions Approach at Chatfield Reservoir,"This model utilizes the application of the Colorado-specific model for wetland habitats, FACwet, to account for terrestrial habitats at Chatfield Reservoir. The model quantifies species/habitat and habitat/function relationships to aid in decision-making and mitigation planning within Chatfield (ERO Resources Corporation, 2009).",Varying,Conceptual/Index/Spatial,"Great plains riparian vegetation with adjacent undisturbed grassland communities.

Lower Willamette River Ecosystem Restoration Project Model,"This model assesses riverine, riparian, and floodplain habitats and their connections to fish and wildlife species. The model adapts existing HSI models for a selection of individual species and addresses the concept of how habitat restoration benefits multiple key fish and wildlife species (Tetra Tech, Inc., 2014).",Northwest,Index,"Aquatic, riparian, & floodplain habitats in the Lower Willamette River between Columbia River and Willamette Falls and Columbia Slough and Tyron Creek.",USACE certification (one-time use),Spreadsheet calculator,,,,,,8,,3,,,,,
Skokomish River Ecosystem Restoration Project Environmental Benefits Analysis,"This model was developed for restoration planning and aims to incorporate positive aspects of multiple existing frameworks, including Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP), HSI, and the Biodiversity Security Index (Cole, 2010). The approach also compares sets of alternatives to identify key spatial gaps in restoration planning (Klimas and Yuill, 2013).",Northwest,Conceptual/Index/Spatial,Skokomish river basin.

The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model,"This U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) tool quantifies water quality benefits of riparian buffers and management zones. The model uses analytical methods to estimate nonpoint source pollution control in various site conditions. It simulates processes including (sub)surface hydrology; sediment transport and deposition; carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus transport, removal, and cycling; and vegetation growth. It also can simulate management options such as vegetation type, buffer zone size, and biomass harvesting (Lowrence et al., 2000).",Varying,Conceptual/Analytical,Built with data from mature riparian forest in south GA but applicable to various sites.

Riparian Aquatic Interaction Simulator,"This model quantifies forest growth and connects it to large wood dynamics, riparian recruitment, and shade. The tool is directly applicable to Pacific Northwest forest types and allows managers to forecast functions over a range of critical variables for up to 300 years (Welty et al., 2001).
